#Project Plan --- Average Sentence Length --- Team 22

##1. Introduction

The goal of this project is to design and implement a java command line tool that will analyze an input text file to determine the average sentence length.  The purpose of the tool is for university students to improve their essay writing by enabling them to track their average words per sentence metric and use it as a benchmark for learning to write more concise sentences.

##2. Process Description

###Initial Planning
Assign roles, define scope and purpose of project, and estimate and agree on a timeline for project delivery.  
**Entrance Criteria:**  Team introduction, project instructions reviewed individually by team members.  
**Exit Criteria:**  Produce project plan document, push final version to repository.
###Requirements Engineering
Determine what the end user needs of the product.  
**Entrance Criteria:**  Completed project plan.  
**Exit Criteria:**  Complete requirements document, push final version to repository.
###Design
Establish the high-level structure of the system by identifying the various components observed during the user interview process and how they fit together. Establish an implementation plan to assign components to developers and identify when to integrate components together.  
**Entrance Criteria:**  Completed requirements document.  
**Exit Criteria:**  High-level design documented, implementation plan established.
###Implementation
Code the components established in the design phase in Java.  Once individual components are implemented, integrate them and confirm the program executes successfully with no errors.  
**Entrance Criteria:**  High-level design completed, implementation plan established.  
**Exit Criteria:**  Functional (i.e. runs with no errors) code pushed to repository.
###Validation and Verification
Design, implement and run comprehensive unit tests including both general use cases and edge cases.  Verify code meets requirements specifications.  
**Entrance Criteria:**  Testable code committed to repo.  
**Exit Criteria:**  Code passes all unit tests.  Final code is pushed to repository.

###Members
* JiaJun (David) Chen
* Sean Colby
* Andrew Kennedy
* Jensen Vang

###Roles
* Project Manager  
Maintains product vision and ensures goals are met to appropriate standard.  Motivates teammates to adhere to the timeline.  Oversees the work of other team members to achieve unified goal.
* Development Lead  
Responsible for delivering functional, professional, and reusable code with the needs of the end user in mind.  This includes delegating coding responsibility to other members, and ensuring they adhere to project requirements.
* Documentation Lead  
Incorporates team input and end-user requirements to produce clear, concise, and comprehensive documents to 1. outline a **Project Plan**, 2. construct a list of **Requirements**, and 3. provide ample **User Documentation** in the form of a textual manual (man) page.  
* QA Manager  
Ensures software quality through monitoring the team’s adherence to agreed upon software processes. With respect to the waterfall process model, this person is responsible for enforcing that the proper criteria are met when advancing to the next phase of the life cycle.
* Developer  
Translates requirements into Java code. Diagnoses and patches issues discovered in the testing phase. 
* Tester
Implements and runs unit and integration tests to ensure code is functional and meets all established requirements. Communicates issues to developers and performs necessary regression testing.

##4. Estimates

###Effort Hours
| Task                     | Time/Person    | # People     | Total          |
| ------------------------ | -------------- |--------------| -------------- |
| Initial Planning         | 1.5 hrs        | 4            | 6.0 hrs        |
| Requirements Engineering | 1.5 hrs        | 4            | 6.0 hrs        |
| Design                   | 1.0 hrs        | 2            | 2.0 hrs        |
| Implementation           | 2.0 hrs        | 3            | 6.0 hrs        |
| Validation/Verification  | 1.0 hrs        | 3            | 3.0 hrs        |
| **Total**                |                |              | **23.0 hrs**   |  

                      
###Lines of Code
The team anticipates the project to require two classes, each with around five methods.  Each class will have a suitable interface.  The team anticipates to include an average of three tests per method.
 
| Component         | Lines of Code |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Class 1 + Methods | 80            |
| Class 1 Interface | 7             |
| Class 2 + Methods | 80            |
| Class 2 Interface | 7             |
| Unit Testing      | 180           |
| **Total:**        | **354**       |

Note: estimates for anticipated effort hours and lines of code are meant to be interpreted as a reasonable approximation based on:
* The team’s current understanding of the scope and extent of the project
* The team’s assessment of their coding efficiency and productivity
* The high-level outline of code structure, which does not yet incorporate significant requirements engineering
